Prototype. Developed in October 2016. Commit made in September 2017. Missing a couple features: mainly the button to export to .stl and different shapes. However, the functionality to export to .stl is there. I coded in the button last year but I am unable to find the final version on my machine.

Works with the Oculus Remote. You can both press into the sphere and extrude from it. 

May have a few bugs.
